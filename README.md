# Incomplete MAD Database Generator for MiSTer and the Arcade Organizer

This project generates the mad files at: https://github.com/theypsilon/MAD_Database_MiSTer

They don't cover all the fields from the schema. The generated files are only meant to be used as a template for new maintainers to write their own MAD DBs.

If you want to become a MAD DB maintainer, follow the instructions from the linked repository above.
